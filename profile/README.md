We're rebranding! 😂

# Welcome to Our Tech Enthusiast Group!
👋 Thank you for visiting our GitHub page.

🙋‍♀ Breaking Plaid is a group dedicated to data science. We are passionate data science enthusiasts dedicated to taking data projects seriously.

🌈 It's welcome to anyone, and there are no set assignments. The only guideline is to be respectful.

🍿 When we tell people we genuinely love data, we get told to "get a life." So, we took it literally and started seriously playing with data.

🧙 Hope this helps you with your journey.

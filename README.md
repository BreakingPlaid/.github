# ðŸ‘‹ Hey you! 

When you see a .github repository, itâ€™s often just used to customize the first thing you see on the main page.
You'll find the cool "Breaking Plaid" logo and our welcome message under the "BreakingPlaid/Profile" folder.
Feel free to use it as a structure to build your own landing page!

## This repository may contain:

- A README that shows up on the organization or profile homepage
- Issue and Pull Request templates to help standardize contributions
- Workflow configurations for GitHub Actions
- Feel free to explore, but thereâ€™s usually not much code here!
